### Create a rough game prototype based on the following brief:
* The player controls a character that moves forward, you can move the character left and right by sliding your finger.
* You can use whatever theme or gameplay elements you want beyond that - It can be an element / your character sliding down a tunnel, a cat chasing a mouse etc.
* The project must use 3D assets.
* Feel free to experiment with camera position, looks, animations etc.
* Make it interesting! Include variety in gameplay - Jumps, collectibles, obstacles etc.
### Add an in-game debug menu, that will allow for changing core gameplay parameters of the game, like:
* Movement parameters
* Camera position parameters,
* Obstacle parameters etc. (the more the better)
* Feel free to include multiple presets to test
